1.Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers
With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. 
It will look good on devices with screens of any width.
You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:
				
			<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>

2.Make Images Mobile Responsive
In order to make an image to fit the width of any device when the website is accessed we enlist
the use of bootstrap's class called 'img-responsive'.

3.Center Text with Bootstrap
In order to center our heading we make use of bootstrap's text-center class. Keep note that we
can have several classes in one line provided each is seperated by a space e.g

            <h2 class="red-text text-center"> Red Centred Heading</h2>

4.Create a Bootstrap Button
Bootstrap has its own way of styling buttons, which are more visually appealing more than the plain
HTML buttons. We use the class "btn btn-default" in order to add a bootstrap button.

5.Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button
Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as
the text that they contain. to make your buttons block level elements meaning no other HTML
element appears horizontally next to it we invoke the "btn-block" bootstrap class, which makes your
bootstrap button to fully spread horizontally on the page and any other element following it will
fall into the next like on the webpage.

6.Bootstrap button colors
In order to add color to your bootstrap button you can invoke the use of "btn-primary" which will
fill your bootstrap button with the primary colour of blue.
